# Use an Arduino to make a LED light blink in the SOS pattern
In this lab you will build a circuit with one LED and one resistor. You will then write a program for the Arduino using Scratch for Arduino to make it blink in the [SOS distress signal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOS) of three short blinks then three long blinks then three more short blinks.

### Step 1: Start the Scratch for Arduino program
You can find it by clicking on the Start Menu at the bottom left of the screen and choosing *S4A*. Since the Arduino has not been connected yet, the S4A program should display a "Searching Board" message.

### Step 2: Connect the Arduino with a USB cable
Connect the Arduino to the computer with a USB cable. The "Searching Board" message should disappear. You can test the connection by dragging a *digital 13 on* block to scripts and clicking on it.

The built in blue LED near pin 13 (shown below) on the Arduino should light up.

To turn the LED off, drag a *digital 13 off* block to scripts and click on it.
